Robin is a postdoc at the University of Texas at Austin in the Integrative Biology department. As part of Dr. Brett Baker’s lab, she studies microbial ecology and evolution via a 20-year, 471-metagenome time series from a freshwater lake. Robin received her PhD from the University of Wisconsin-Madison where she worked in Dr. Trina McMahon’s lab. During her PhD, she worked on taxonomic methods for freshwater 16S rRNA gene amplicon data (https://github.com/McMahonLab/TaxAss), and she explored the impact of aquatic invasive species on microbial communities.
